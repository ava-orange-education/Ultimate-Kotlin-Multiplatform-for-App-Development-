# TaskLite Kotlin Multiplatform Project

TaskLite is a task management application developed using Kotlin Multiplatform. The project shares business logic and core data models across Android and iOS platforms, enabling code reuse and easier maintenance.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Shared Module

- The Shared module contains the common logic and data models written in Kotlin.
- Core data model: `Task` with properties such as `id`, `title`, and `isDone` (task completion status).
- Business logic and state management handled via `TaskViewModel` which maintains a list of tasks and exposes them as reactive `StateFlow`.
- Repository pattern (`TaskRepository`) abstracts data source and provides APIs to load, add, update, and delete tasks.
- Uses Kotlin Coroutines and `StateFlow` for asynchronous and reactive state management.
- Supports multiplatform via `expect/actual` declarations for platform-specific implementations when necessary.
- Dependency Injection is configured using Koin with modules defined in `sharedModule`.

### Android Module

- Android-specific implementation and UI layer reside here.
- Uses Android ViewModel, LiveData and Jetpack-Compose for UI updates (depending on the exact details).
- Accesses shared business logic and repositories from the Shared module.
- AndroidManifest and platform-specific resources are configured here.
- Uses Kotlin Coroutines for background operations.

### iOS Module

- iOS platform-specific implementation is written in Swift or Kotlin/Native bindings to UI frameworks.
- Utilizes the shared codebase for business logic and data models.
- Bridges between Kotlin Multiplatform shared code and native iOS UI framework (e.g. SwiftUI or UIKit).
- Platform-specific features are implemented via `actual` implementation in the shared module.

## Technologies and Patterns

- Kotlin Multiplatform for sharing code between platforms.
- MVVM architecture pattern to separate UI and business logic.
- Reactive programming with Kotlin Coroutines and StateFlow.
- Repository pattern for data abstraction.
- Dependency Injection with Koin.
- Platform-specific implementations with `expect`/`actual`.

## Further Improvements (to try out/explore Kotlin Multiplatform capabilities)

- Add persistent local storage using SQLDelight or Realm to save tasks across app launches.
- Integrate synchronization with a backend service for cloud backup and multi-device support.
- Implement advanced task features like due dates, categories, and priorities.
- Add unit and UI tests to improve reliability and maintainability.
- Enhance the iOS UI integration with SwiftUI.
- Support additional platforms like desktop or web.
- Add multi-language support for internationalization.
- Implement task notifications and reminders.

This project demonstrates how Kotlin Multiplatform can be used to build a multi-platform mobile app with shared business logic and platform-specific UI implementations.
